# Hey, I'm Anibal 👋

I'm not just a back-end developer; I'm a coding chameleon. Give me a language or framework, and I'll dance with it. Currently twirling through the realms of Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Master of Many

- **Languages:** Fluent in Node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript. Also conversant in Python, Java, and more.
- **Frameworks:** Currently orchestrating the symphony with Express.js, but always ready to swing with anything new.

## 💡 The Learning Lair

I dwell in the Learning Lair, where every new challenge is a dragon to be tamed. Here are the quests on my horizon:

- 🐍 Embarking on an adventure with React.js for a pet project.
- 🚀 Setting out to explore Rust for building a networking tool.
- ☕️ Preparing to dive into Java as I chart a backend journey.

## 🚀 Tech Stacks & Sorcery

- **Databases:** SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB)
- **API Spells:** Fluent in REST
- **DevOps Enchantments:** Docker, Git incantations

## 🧐 Code Connoisseur

I'm not just about making it work; I'm about making it work flawlessly. A connoisseur of clean code and a zealot for performance optimization.
## 🤝 Ready to Collaborate

Embarking on a new quest? Seeking a versatile spellcaster? Count me in. Let's create some magic together!

## 🚀 Fun Side Quests

- I once wrote a chatbot in Shakespearean English. 🎭
